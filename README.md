# pixelmon-ecobridge
a simple economy bridge that bridges the pixelmon economy to a vault-compatible economy for use with spigot/forge hybrid servers.

this effectively makes it so external plugins can interact with the pixelmon economy seamlessly. simply install this plugin along with vault and any vault-compatible plugins will be able to interact with pokedollars out of the box.
